# Homework 10

You will fill out the following
questionnaire for each program and submit the answers as your final homework. You will
also share your questionnaire with the group that created the program __by the end of discussion__.
---

### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
There is a README file. It includes the title and their name, but lacks contact info

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
Yes, the program is ment to how three variables change overtime when exposed to fatal and non-fatal disease.

#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
Yes, its easy to understand. The work flow details the different variable that the model will look at and other information. I would try to find a way to display the images of the figures that you tried to include in the README as an actual picture.

#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
Yes there are dependencies in R, but no specifically in Hoffman 

#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
In the section "How to Run Program" there is a link to the shiny app which takes me to the model, which is easy to interact with. If you want to be super tedious you can add instructions on how you can change the variables/ what each variable is.

### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
Since its a shiny app it doesnt produce directories/ files, so instead the expected output lists that a graph will be outputed with every change. It might be redundant but mayble explain what parameter each line related to.

#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
It does acknowledge all its sources and mentors

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
It does include the program script!

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
N/A
---

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
No (idk if it needs a vignette since its a shiny app)

#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
The shiny app did work for me. I think theyre could be a few things added to the shiny app, like a title, a bit of explanation of things 

#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
Yes

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
I think that the interface of the shiny could be more refined. For instance you can add,
- a title and even a little intro would be cool
- maybe even instractions in case a user finds the shiny app and doesn't read the README
- an Explanation of what variable each line is related to 
Dont forget to add your contact info (i.e. email)
